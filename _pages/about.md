I am a data scientist at [Boston Consulting Group](https://www.bcg.com/x/). I'm working on CVM (customer value maximization) for major telcos.

I was previously a team lead at [DSO National Laboratories](https://www.dso.org.sg) working on large language models. I'm most proud of leading the pretraining team (with no experience) to pretrain a model that's competitive with SEA AI Lab. There, I also contributed to the open-source pretraining library ([TinyLlama](https://github.com/jzhang38/TinyLlama/issues/67)).

I graduated from [National University of Singapore](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg) Computer Science with a first class honours. During my time there, I tried out research on NLP and bayesian optimization but found out I'm a better engineer than I am a researcher.
