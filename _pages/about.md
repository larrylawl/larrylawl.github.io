I am a Research Engineer at [DSO National Laboratories](https://www.dso.org.sg). I'm interested in large language models.

I graduated from [National University of Singapore](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg) Computer Science. I was also part of the [Turing Research Programme](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/programmes/ug/cs/tp/).

Previously, I researched on semi-supervised text classification at DSO under [Hai Leong](https://chaileon.github.io) and [Prof Wee Sun](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~leews/). I also researched on Bayesian Optimisation at NUS under [A/P Bryan Low](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~lowkh/research.html).
