I am a CS senior at the [National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg), wherein I am part of the [Turing Research Programme](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/programmes/ug/cs/tp/). 

I am currently researching on Natural Language Processing (NLP) at [DSO National Laboratories](https://www.dso.org.sg) under the supervision of [Dr Chieu](https://chaileon.github.io) and [Prof Wee Sun](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~leews/). From 2020 to 2021, I researched on Bayesian Optimisation at NUS under [A/P Bryan Low](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~lowkh/research.html). 

I have also built an automatic github issue labeller using NLP. The labeller is published in the [market place](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/auto-github-issue-labeller). 

I am currently searching for full-time NLP engineer positions for 2022.
