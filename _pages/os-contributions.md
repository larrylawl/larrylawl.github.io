While I work in defence, I love open source (OS)! I try to contribute to OS in my small ways. Here's a list of my contributions:

- [Accelerate support for GLM](https://huggingface.co/THUDM/glm-10b-chinese/discussions/2)
- [Alpaca Indon dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/larrylawl/alpaca-cleaned-indon)
- [豆瓣读书 dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/larrylawl/douban-dushu)
