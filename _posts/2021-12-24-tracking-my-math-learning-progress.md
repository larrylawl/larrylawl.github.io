Learning math for the love of it!

## Motivation
<!-- interest -->
<!-- intellectual stimulation that's hard to describe. elegance, nice to see it's application in research, nice to ground research in first principles. -->
<!-- really, just doing this for the love of it. realise i tend to overanalyse things || my decisions, thus in this spirit, wanna tone it down a little bit, and do things for the love of it! -->

<!-- Papers which I enjoy reading the most are grounded in math! One day, I hope to write || apply one myself :) Good to bring up my fundamentals such that it bridges the gap between what I know and what I need to know -->
Papers which I enjoy reading the most are gounded in math! One day, I hope to write or apply such papers myself 😊. As such, I'm revising my math fundamentals such that it bridges the gap between what I already know (i.e. fundamentals) and what I need to know (i.e. specific math knowledge for my research).

Well... that's the rationale reason; I'm really doing this simply cause I love math and wish to keep learning it beyond university 😁.

<!-- ## Topics which I wish to cover
- Probability and Statistics (ST2132)
- A-Level H2 Mathematics
- Linear Algebra II (MA2101) -->

<!-- Possibly find A level math tuition after covering a-level h2 math? -->

## I'm currently revising...
**Probability and Statistics** (ST2132): Probability, Random Variables, Joint Distributions, Expected Values, Limit Theorems, Distributions Derived from the Normal Distribution, Estimation of Parameters and Fitting of Probability Distributions, Testing Hypothesis and Assessing Goodness of fit.
